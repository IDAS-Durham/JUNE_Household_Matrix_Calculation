# JUNE Household CM

Calculations for determining the household mixing matrix for [JUNE UK](https://github.com/IDAS-Durham/JUNE). We use the total population reported from [ONS - NOMIS](www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/KS102UK/view/2092957697?cols=measures) and household types reported from [ONS - Household types](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/KS105UK/view/2092957697?cols=measures) and child birth rates from
 [ONS - Dependants rate](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/adhocs/008855familieswithdependentchildrenbynumberofchildrenuk1996to2017).

These data are used to take normalised by population contact matrices into normalised by venue contact matrices types for the setting of a UK Household.

The results are compared to the [BBC Pandemic project](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.20023754v2.full).
